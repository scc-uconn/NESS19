The Department of Statistics of the University of Connecticut (UConn)
is proud to host the 33rd New England Statistics Symposium (NESS) on
May 16--18, 2019.  As an annual event, NESS has been bringing together
statisticians from all over New England to a central location to share
research, discuss emerging issues in the field, and network with
colleagues since it was first started at UConn in 1987. After the
establishment of the New England Statistical Society in 2017, we are
proud to host the first remodeled NESS to bring NESS to a new level.


The symposium will be a 3-day event, featuring short-courses, plenary
talks, invited sessions, career development panel discussion, student
paper competition, student poster competition, statathon, and Chernoff
Lecture. In addition to being a larger scale event, two new features
are the statathon and the Chernoff Lecture.

## Statathon
Students are encouraged to compete in the Statathon, our exclusive
brandname for an event similar to a hackathon but with more focus on
statistics. A realworld data science
problem will be revealed on Saturday, May 18, 2019, and teams work on
the spot to find a solution. A review panel will select a few
finalists to present in the first afternoon session, and the winners
will receive their award at the closing ceremony. Team registration
will be closed on Monday, May 6, 2019.

## Chernoff Lecture
The New England Statistical Society has created the Chernoff
Excellence in Statistics Award to commemorate Herman Chernoff’s
outstanding, long-term contributions to the field of statistics. These
contributions include work on large sample theory, experimental
design, sequential analysis, methods of presenting statistical data in
visual form, and statistical decision making. 
The Chernoff Excellence in Statistics Awards is the most prestigious
award bestowed by the NESS, given to an individual who, in the
tradition of Herman Chernoff’s work, has made exceptional
contributions to the theory, methodology, or novel applications to
statistics and/or data science. The awardee will be revealed at the
last session on Saturday, May 18, 2019, and the awardee will give the
Chernoff Lecture.
