# Introduction

The Department of Statistics of the University of Connecticut (UConn) is proud to host the 33rd New England Statistics Symposium (NESS) on May 15–17, 2019 at Hilton Hartford. The theme of the conference is "Statistical Data Science in Action. As an annual event, NESS has been bringing together statisticians from all over New England to a central location to share research, discuss emerging issues in the field, and network with colleagues since it was first started at UConn in 1987. After the establishment of the New England Statistical Society in 2017, we are proud to host the first remodeled NESS and bring it to a new level.

The symposium will be a 3-day event, featuring short-courses, plenary talks, invited sessions, career development panel discussion, student paper competition, student poster competition, stat-a-thon, and Chernoff Lecture. In addition to being a larger scale event, three new features are a banquet address, the stat-a-thon, and the Chernoff Lecture.
