The first Statathon will be held jointly by UConn Statistics Department and NESS NextGen during the 33rd New England Statistics Symposium on May 16--18, 2019. 

# Introduction

## Statathon
   
Statathon is an statistical data science invention marathon. 
The trademark is owned by University of Connecticut. Anyone who has an
interest in data science attends a statathon to approach a real world data science problem, some of which are local, in new and innovative ways.
It emphasizes the statistical aspects (insight, interpretation, significance,
etc.) of data science problems that are often overlooked in many hackathons.

## NextGen

NextGen is a newly-formed committee within NESS supporting the next generation of statisticians and data scientists, with the mission to ensure those new to statistics and data science have resources available through the New England Statistical Society that can help them to thrive in their respective areas of interest, and provide a platform for them to contribute to the betterment of the New England Statistical Society.

# Timeline

* May 1-6, 2019: team online registration opens until a cap is reached; each team should submit only one registration form with all names of the team members.
* May 16, 2019: data sets released online with instructions (need details), and teams start to work to find solutions. 
* May 18, 2019: team presents to the review panel in the first afternoon session, and winners will receive their awards at the closing ceremony (We need to decide whether all participating teams will present or we pre-select a finalist to come and present. We plant to let the Statathon participants to attend the NESS for free, so we need an idea about the number of people in order to prepare for food.)

# Theme (Data sets will be provided by Tyler Kleycamp, Chief Data Officer, Office of Policy and Management)

## 1. Population and Migration
There are a variety of data source that depict the population of Connecticut and various migration trends both in and out of the state. Often these data do not paint the complete picture of Connecticut’s population and migration trends. Beyond simply understanding migration trends, what else might be influencing people to stay, leave, or move to Connecticut? What is the impact, either positive or negative of these changes?

## 2. Housing
Access to affordable housing has a significant impact on Connecticut’s economy and ability to attract and retain people. In addition, as a result of the great recession, many homeowners have not realized an appreciation in equity that is typically realized from owning a home. How can we better understand the impacts of the accessibility and affordability of housing? What is the impact on Connecticut’s economy? How can we help identify affordable and accessible places to live?
