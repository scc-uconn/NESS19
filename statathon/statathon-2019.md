The first Statathon will be held jointly by UConn Statistics Department and NESS NextGen during the 33rd New England Statistics Symposium on May 15--17, 2019. 

# Introduction

## Statathon
   
Statathon is an statistical data science invention marathon. 
The trademark is owned by University of Connecticut. Anyone who has an
interest in data science attends a statathon to approach a real world data science problem, some of which are local, in new and innovative ways.
It emphasizes the statistical aspects (insight, interpretation, significance,
etc.) of data science problems that are often overlooked in many hackathons.

## NextGen

NextGen is a newly-formed committee within NESS supporting the next generation of statisticians and data scientists, with the mission to ensure those new to statistics and data science have resources available through the New England Statistical Society that can help them to thrive in their respective areas of interest, and provide a platform for them to contribute to the betterment of the New England Statistical Society.

# Theme and Data

There are two themes for this Statathon. You may choose one that is interesting to you. Related data sets are provided for each theme. You are encouraged to use related data from other sources. 

<!-- ## 1. Population and Migration -->
<!-- There are a variety of data source that depict the population of Connecticut and various migration trends both in and out of the state. Often these data do not paint the complete picture of Connecticut’s population and migration trends. Beyond simply understanding migration trends, what else might be influencing people to stay, leave, or move to Connecticut? What is the impact, either positive or negative of these changes? -->

## Theme 1: Housing
Access to affordable housing has a significant impact on Connecticut’s economy and ability to attract and retain people. In addition, as a result of the great recession, many homeowners have not realized an appreciation in equity that is typically realized from owning a home. How can we better understand the impacts of the accessibility and affordability of housing? What is the impact on Connecticut’s economy? How can we help identify affordable and accessible places to live?

## Theme 2: TBA

# Logistic

## Registration 

All teams should register online. 
<!-- Online; to be developed similar to the conference pages or use Google Form. -->
Each team may have up to four team members, and only one registration form should be submit by each team with all names of the team members. 
If you do not have a team but want to be a part of one, then indicate that in the registration form and the organizers will try to match you up with similar participants. (WHY: we need to ask their theme preference in registration in order to match teams. Another option is to provide a forum for participants to share their information and form their teams. I am not sure if this has technical difficult or has any privacy issue or not.)

## Report submission

All teams should submit their work by the deadline (04/26/2019). 
Each team should submit a report along with other produce such as program codes used in the analysis, software products, links to other data sources if used, etc. It is preferred that report is in the format of presentation slides. Teams are encouraged to create a Git Repository (e.g., [Bitbucket](	bitbucket.org), [GitHub](github.com)) to host their source codes and data information. However, this is not a review factor in the competition. 

## Team presentations

Ten teams will be selected in the finalist, and they are invited to give team presentations to the review panel in the afternoon session of 05/16/2019. All team members in the finalist will be registered in the NESS conference for free. Each team will have ten minutes to present their findings and products.
