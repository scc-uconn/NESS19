This is motivated from the observation that proper statistical inference is somewhat being downplayed in many modern data analytics problems, which may cause biased/misleading results and reproducibility issues. Many of our students are now more motivated to learn new programing languages, blackbox prediction machineries and ways of creating fancy displays of data, but less motivated to dig into making proper statistical inference. It is therefore timely to showcase the role and advances of inference tools and discuss their proper use in modern applications.

Title: Two-Sample Sequential Methodologies for Tests of Hypotheses with Applications: Comparing Normal Means When the Two Variances Are Unknown and Unequal.

Abstract: We develop appropriate sampling methodologies for testing hypotheses regarding the difference of mean values from two independent (or dependent) normal populations when their variances are unknown and unequal. We design two-stage and purely
sequential testing methodologies of hypotheses for comparing the unknown means by determining the appropriate sample sizes while controlling both type-I and type-II error probabilities at or below preassigned levels alpha, beta respectively. Such methodologies are constructed under both unequal and equal sample size designs. We prove that both two-stage and purely sequential testing strategies enjoy a number of practically appealing properties. Extensive sets of computer simulations and real data analyses empirically validate our theoretical findings.

Title: Prior Adaptive Semi-supervised Learning with Application to Electronic Health Records Phenotyping

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) provides large and rich data sources for biomedical researches, and EHR data have been successfully used to gain novel insights into several diseases. However, the usage of EHR data remains quite limited, because extracting precise phenotype for individual patient requires labor intensive medical chart review and such a manual process is not scalable. To facilitate an automatic procedure for accurate phenotyping, we formulate the problem in a high dimensional setting and propose a semi-supervised method that combine information from chart reviewed records with some data-driven prior knowledge derived from the entire dataset. The proposed estimator, Prior Adaptive Semi-supervised (PASS) estimator, enjoys nice theoretical properties including efficiency and robustness, and applies to a broad class of problems beyond EHR applications. The finite sample performance is evaluated via simulation studies and a real dataset on rheumatoid arthritis phenotyping. Further improvements involving word embedding and selective sampling are discussed.

Title: Bayesian Network Meta-Regression Hierarchical
Models Using Heavy-Tailed Multivariate Random
Effects with Covariate-Dependent Variances

Abstract
Network meta-analysis (NMA) is gaining popularity in evidence synthesis. Network
meta-regression (NMR) allows us to incorporate potentially important covariates into
network meta-analysis. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian network meta-regression
hierarchical model and assume a general multivariate t distribution for the random treatment effects. The multivariate t distribution is desired for heavy-tailed outcome variables
and converges to the multivariate normal distribution when the degrees of freedom go to
infinity. Moreover, we allow for a general development in which the observed treatments
for each study can be far less than the total collection of treatments in the data and some
treatments can be compared only in single studies. To overcome such sparsity, we propose
a log-linear regression model for the variances of the random effects and incorporate ag-
gregate covariates into modeling the variance components. We specify different degrees of
freedom for the multivariate t distribution as well as different combinations of covariates
for the log-linear model, and utilize the deviance information criterion to perform model
comparison. Finally, we carry out a detailed analysis from our motivating case study and
point out a few directions for future methodological development.

Title: Geographically Weighted Cox regression for Prostate Cancer Survival Data in Louisiana

Abstract
The Cox proportional hazard model is one of the most popular tools in
analyzing time-to-event data in public health studies. When outcomes
observed in clinical data from di_erent regions yield a varying
pattern correlated with location, it is often of great interest to
investigate spatially varying e_ects of covariates. In this paper, we
propose a geographically weighted Cox regression model for sparse
spatial survival data. In addition, a stochastic neighborhood
weighting scheme is introduced at the county level. Theoretical
properties of the proposed geographically weighted estimators are
examined in detail. A model selection scheme based on the Takeuchi’s
model robust information criteria (TIC) is discussed. Extensive
simulation studies are carried out to examine the empirical
performance of the proposed methods. We further apply the proposed
methodology to analyze real data on prostate cancer from the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry for the
state of Louisiana.

Back to the Basics: Another look on designing Clinical Trial with Sample size re-estimation

Abstract: Sample size re-estimation (SSR) is one of the most commonly used adaptive design. While type I error control has been a long-standing and well-studied topic in Sample size re-estimation, less attention has been given to constructing an efficient and sensible sample size re-estimation rule. SSR rule is usually defined using conditional power based on current trend. It is important to note that such design usually assumed that observed treatment effect is the true treatment effect, which may not necessarily be true. The variability of the estimated treatment effect at interim analysis need to be considered. It is very important to choose an appropriate maximum limit for allowable sample size, and an efficient promising zone for sample size increase. In this talk, we will discuss how to use the information from clinical perspective and statistical perspective to construct an efficient SSR rule, and avoid the common pitfalls in SSR design.

Abstract: Efficacy assessment in early phase cancer clinical trials often focuses on objective response, which is a binary indicator of tumor size reduction based on the RECIST criteria. Despite losing the longitudinal information of tumor growth, objective response provides a reliable measure for the anti-tumor activities of chemotherapy which mainly act through direct killing of tumor cells. Unlike cytotoxic agents, immune therapies can result in more durable responses among responders and provide a survival benefit to some non-responders whose tumor size is not significantly reduced. To better measure the effect of anti-tumor agents, we developed a Bayesian non-linear mixed effects model, which includes an exponential decay and an exponential growth term. The observed tumor growth of patient i is determined by both the decay parameter di representing the tumor cell killing rate of the anti-tumor agent and the grow parameter gi representing the tumor cell replication rate. The relative strength of di and gi determines whether or not tumor will shrink in response to treatment.  Clinically interpretable parameters including response rate, maximum tumor burden reduction and duration of response can be derived from this model. We illustrate the proposed model using data from a phase II trial of non-small cell lung cancer and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in predicting long term benefits of treatment (overall survival) compared to RECIST based response criteria.

Bayesian Interim Monitoring and Sample Size Re-estimation

An interim analysis in clinical trials provides advantages over a fixed-sample design. With the right amount of cumulative information, it can effectively detect safety issues and terminate inefficacious drugs. Not only does terminating a trial early cut cost, save time and resources in drug development, prevent exposure of unsafe toxicity to the patients, but it also expedites the clinical development process. Bayesian interim monitoring accumulates information from the current trial and also utilize the existing trials. At the design stage, incorporating prior information for treatment effects and variance parameter,  decision metrics in Bayesian interim analysis will be discussed. Timing and frequency of interim analyses will be considered through simulation. When the prior information used for design is not true, it is necessary to evaluate the model performance, operating characteristics and sample size determination.

Evaluating MCP-Mod for Dose Finding and Dose-Response Estimation in Dose -Ranging Clinical Trial

Qing Zhao 
Association Principal Scientist, Biostatistics, Merck & Co Inc.
happysundae@gmail.com

Investigating dose-response relationships and identifying the appropriate dose for confirmatory studies are important and challenging goals during drug development. Multiple Comparison Procedures & Modeling (MCP-Mod), a combination of MCP principles and modeling techniques, provides the flexibility of modeling for dose estimation, while preserving the rigor associated with MCP. The approach is further extended to perform dose-response modeling and testing in the context of general parametric model. We examine via simulation the performance of MCP-Mod in terms of both continuous and binary endpoints by comparing it with several common approaches used in dose response studies including trend tests and pairwise comparisons. The evaluation includes not only the power to identify the dose-response signal, target dose estimates based on a minimum effective dose (MED), but also the response estimation at target dose. The analysis of a Phase II clinical trial is further used to demonstrate its application in the dose selection process interacting with the regulatory agencies.

Researchers in the area  of computer science study learning theory mainly focusing on the convergence of estimation and convergence of algorithm, while asymptotic distribution is widely ignored. However, inferential theory plays an important role in both theoretical and applied statistics, which is of more interest for statisticians.  In this section, we will focus on developing statistical inference on learning theory.

Our research team at the University of Massachusetts Medical School works with MassHealth, the agency that administers our State’s Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Programs (CHIP). MassHealth members are highly diverse. We use statistical models to help MassHealth manage and evaluate its programs and initiatives. For example: 
1.	Making equitable payments 
Currently, most managed care payment formulas allocate more money for medically complex populations but ignore social determinants of health (SDH). We evaluate adding SDH variables to the diagnosis-based formulas that help determine payments to managed care plans and accountable care organizations.
2.	Creating equitable quality measures
In measuring healthcare quality, it is increasingly recognized that some form of risk adjustment may be needed to incentivize providers to deliver high-quality care while avoiding penalizing safety net providers that can achieve expected outcomes for their disadvantaged populations.
3.	Estimating the effect of policy interventions
As MassHealth implements several specific (large and small) changes in the health care delivery system, we will examine changes in outcomes (e.g., cost and quality) for MassHealth members, and seek to attribute changes in outcomes to policy initiatives.
4.	Developing new quality measures that account for both medical and social risk
For example, MassHealth hopes to encourage and reward health plans for increasing community tenure, that is, the length of time that vulnerable members spend in the community. We are building models to predict such outcomes for members with behavioral disorders or those who need long term services and supports.

Title: Risk-Adjusted Quality Measure Model for Emergency Department Visits in Medicaid Adult Population with Severe Mental Illness and Substance Use Disorders. 
In evaluating quality in health care, measures may require risk adjustment. Our study demonstrates the utility of risk adjustment approaches for an emergency department (ED) quality measure to assess Accountable Care Organization (ACO) performance among MassHealth members with severe mental illness (SMI) and/or substance use disorders (SUD). These groups have elevated rates of ED use compared to the general population. To the extent that excess ED visits in a SMI/SUD population is a sign of inadequate clinical management, ACOs with lower ED visit rates are viewed as providing better care. We describe the development of a multivariable model to predict ED visits for a risk-adjusted quality measure in MassHealth, and consider its predictive power, model calibration, and implications for important subgroups.

Title: Statistical approaches to evaluating changes in opioid overdoses in Massachusetts: challenges and strategies
In parallel to ACO transformation, MassHealth is using 1115 Waiver Demonstration funds to address the opioid addiction crisis by expanding access to a broad spectrum of recovery-oriented substance use disorder services.  The evaluation will examine changes in quality measures, costs and outcomes of members with substance use disorders pre- to post-implementation of services. This talk will examine the challenges faced and the strategies developed to evaluate a key outcome, opioid overdoses, in the context of multiple concurrent state, local, and national initiatives to address the opioid crisis.

Title: Matching Payment to Need: Risk Adjusting Medicaid Payment for Long-Term Services and Supports in an Elderly Dual-Eligible Population
Among Medicare-Medicaid eligible older adults, long-term services and supports (LTSS) constitutes the largest spending category for Medicaid programs because Medicare does not cover most LTSS. Using community based LTSS services to delay or prevent entry into institutional settings is both a patient-centered goal and a potentially cost-saving approach for Medicaid programs. We sought to develop a model using demographic, clinical, social, cognitive, and functional status data to predict differences in need for LTSS services among community-dwelling dual eligible members enrolled in managed senior care organizations in Massachusetts. 
Predictive models developed using administrative data and functional status information could identify and allocate payments for subgroups of members with LTSS needs that differ substantially from average. Underscoring the importance of risk adjustment in for this population, without risk adjustment, plans would receive only about half of their costs for members in the highest decile of model predicted LTSS cost. Since member characteristics vary substantially across the studied senior care organizations, risk adjustment of a fixed program budget allocates meaningfully different capitation payments to plans. Calibrating payment to need mitigates incentives for population skimming and promotes the sustainability of mission-oriented organizations that care for the most complex and vulnerable populations. Our findings are relevant and timely, as state and federal policymakers seek to manage LTSS costs for dual Medicare-Medicaid enrollees.

Title: Retention within the Community as a Quality Measure 
Community tenure is defined as days when at-risk members reside in a community setting without using acute or post-acute inpatient services. Increased community tenure is a desired patient outcome, that may also lower Medicaid spending. Thus, in addition to more traditional measures, such as, reductions in ED visits and hospital readmissions, MassHealth has permission from CMS to develop a community tenure quality measure for its members, aged 18 to 64 years, who have either behavioral health diagnoses or have used LTSS services for at least 3 consecutive months. We will conduct a retrospective cohort study with secondary, administrative data from MassHealth Medicaid (2015-2018) and explore a range of modeling options for capturing systematic differences in community tenure within this highly heterogeneous target population.

39,"March 14, 2019",Elizabeth Schifano,elizabeth.schifano@uconn.edu,University of Connecticut,Novel Statistical Methods for the Analysis of Genomic Data,"In this session, we present a collection of recent developments of novel strategies and methods for the statistical analysis of genomic data.  By design, all of these methods are necessarily computational efficient and/or computationally feasible given the massive nature of sequencing data and expression quantitative trait loci data.  The topics proposed in this session cover a wide variety of statistical methods that are also of interest more broadly (beyond the genomics context) including: robust non-parametric and non-asymptotic inference methods; unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches for predicting functional effects; scan statistics to simultaneously detect the existence, and estimate the location of an association signal; novel variance component model estimation methods; and mediation analysis for multiple mediators.  

A brief description of each talk is given below, followed by a list indicating the affiliation, contact email, and tentative talk titles for each speaker.
 
Dr. Tamar Sofer, from Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, will present a non-parametric, non-asymptotic, carriers-only tests for the association of rare variants with a trait. These tests can be applied to low-count variants, for which statistical asymptotic properties may not hold, while still allowing proper statistical inference and being computationally efficient. These tests require the estimation of a single (possibly mixed) regression model under the null hypothesis of no variant effect on the outcome (i.e. model with only covariates), and then using predicted means from these null models for testing whether carriers of a rare variant have extreme phenotypes. 

Dr. Iuliana Ionita-Laza, from the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, will present several integrative statistical approaches for the analysis of whole-genome sequencing data. Continuous advances in massively parallel sequencing technologies make large whole-genome sequencing studies increasingly feasible. The analysis of such data is challenging due to the large number of rare variants in noncoding regions of the genome, our poor understanding of their functional effects, and the lack of natural units for testing (e.g. the analogue of genes in coding regions). She will discuss an unsupervised approach based on a latent Dirichlet allocation model to predict functional effects of genetic variants in a cell type/tissue specific manner; further extensions to the semi-supervised setting where high-quality experimentally derived labels are available for a small to modest number of variants; and GenoScan, a scan statistic approach to simultaneously detect the existence, and estimate the location of the association signal in a pre-specified large region or at genome-wide scale. 

Dr. Lorin Crawford, from Brown University, will present a marginal epistasis test for detecting genetic interaction. Epistasis, commonly defined as the interaction between multiple genes, is an important genetic component underlying phenotypic variation. Many statistical methods have been developed to model and identify epistatic interactions between genetic variants. However, because of the large combinatorial search space of interactions, most of these methods face enormous computational challenges and often suffer from low statistical power due to multiple test correction. He will present a novel, alternative strategy for mapping epistasis: instead of directly identifying individual pairwise or higher-order interactions, we focus on mapping variants that have non-zero marginal epistatic effects—the combined pairwise interaction effects between a given variant and all other variants. The method is based on a variance component model, and relies on a recently developed variance component estimation method for efficient parameter inference and p-value computation. 

Dr. Zuoheng Anita Wang, from the Yale School of Public Health, will discuss identification of trans-expression quantitative trait loci (trans-eQTLs) using mediation analysis with multiple mediators. Identification of eQTLs advances our understanding of genetics and regulatory mechanisms of gene expression in various organisms. Previous studies suggest that trans-eQTLs may regulate expression of remote genes by altering the expression of nearby genes. Trans-association has been studied in the mediation analysis with a single mediator. However, prior applications with one mediator are prone to model misspecification due to correlations between genes. Motivated from the observation that trans-eQTLs are more likely to associate with more than one cis-gene than randomly selected SNPs in the GTEx dataset, she will present a computational method to identify trans-eQTLs that are mediated by multiple mediators.

This session will present novel spatial and spatio-temporal statistical models that aim to advance the field of air pollution epidemiology by providing both methods for air pollution exposure assessment as well as statistical methods that can yield a deeper understanding of factors that affect daily patterns of air pollutants concentration. 
Considering an urban environment, Phil White will present a Bayesian nonparametric approach that can be used to cluster hourly air pollution data, and more generally, functional data, based on their relationship to exogenous variables.
Still set in an intra-urban environment, Owais Gilani will present a novel Bayesian non-stationary spatial statistical model that, by leveraging the output of a dispersion model along with information on multiple exogenous variables, will yield improved estimates of traffic-related air pollutants concentrations to be used in air pollution epidemiological studies. 
Working still in the context of data fusion models, Howard Chang will present a new data fusion modeling approach that exploits the information on air pollution concentration contained in both the output of an atmospheric-chemistry model and in satellite retrievals of aerosol optical depth. 
Finally, Alexandra Larsen will conclude the session with a spatial causal inference method to estimate the amount of wildfire-contributed PM2.5 in the U.S. and the associated health burden as well as a machine learning algorithm for automatically detecting wildfire smoke in satellite imagery.

At the same time, it also poses many methodological challenges. Novel statistical models are in great need, in order to understand the prevalence of drug misuse and associated risk factors, mechanisms of the transition processes during outbreaks, and designing effective interventions. Many challenges also exist in charactering the epidemics and policy evaluation by leveraging new sources of data, such as from non-probabilistic surveys, large electronic health record databases, emergency medical services records, etc. We propose an invited session to discuss recent methodological developments in the research of opioid and drug misuses, and evaluation of interventions from observational studies.

In particular, data with high dimensionality has fundamentally transformed many research fields as well as decision making processes in industrial, meanwhile demands new statistical methodology and philosophy for modeling and inference. For example, high dimensional data requires novel ideas to test traditional hypotheses for multivariate data while they can boost the power and control the false positive rate given the large number of dependent hypotheses under consideration; inference for generalized linear model under the high dimensional setting, on the other hand, reveals other new statistical perspectives including how the high dimensional geometry of the null set affects the efficiency of test and estimation; and inference on data collected from large graphs requires different statistical viewpoints on modeling high dimensional data with specific structures.

Identifying and estimating causal effects has become a vital part of applied statistics, especially for medical interventions and policy evaluations in political science, economics and other social sciences. Identification can be challenging when there are intervention occurs at more than one time point, or if dynamic treatment strategies are used.  For example, in medical interventions, the assignment of a new treatment may depend on previous treatments and patients’ reactions to previous treatments. In sociological and infectious disease studies, one individual’s outcome may be affected by other individuals’ outcomes, in addition to their treatments, in continuous time. Innovations in the theory of causal inference with time-varying interventions have occurred rapidly in the past few years, and researchers have developed a wide variety of frameworks, causal estimands, and statistical approaches to learn causal relationships time-varying interventions. However, new methods are still underutilized in empirical applications in public health, infectious disease epidemiology, economics, and social science.

We propose an invited session to address the challenges of translating theoretical advances in causal inference for time-varying interventions into routine statistical practice.  The speakers’ presentations will introduce novel methods for evaluating time-varying intervention’s effect and empirical applications of techniques, emphasizing practical implementation and real-world considerations.  The speakers are leaders in statistics, epidemiology, causal inference, and network analysis.

The focus of this session is novel statistical methods for network-based studies and/or causal inference studies aimed at substance use disorder treatment and prevention. Individuals are embedded in social networks or communities (e.g., schools, drug use, sexual) and they exert biological and social influence on members of their networks. In these networks, public health interventions, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV, naloxone distribution, and educational interventions, could be strengthened by leveraging these disseminated or spillover effects, and intervention effects frequently depend on the network structure and intervention coverage levels. The session will have 4 speakers and a discussant.

64,"March 19, 2019",Ali Yousefi,yousefi@bu.edu,Postdoctoral Fellow,Advancement in the Marked-Point Process Modeling Framework for Real-Time Neural Data Analysis,"Sorting of individual spike waveforms into neuronal identities was traditionally the first step in relating population neural activity to behavior.  However, this step has the potential to introduce human bias, and skipping the step all together is preferable in certain applications, and a joint model of behavior and features of unsorted spike waveforms, called the joint mark intensity function, across the neural population can be built directly (Kloosterman et al. 2014; Deng et al. 2015; Sodkomkham et al. 2016).  Models of this type can be described using the theory of marked point process models (Daley and Vere-Jones 2003), in which a random mark variable is associated with each spike.  Marks could be the full spike waveform, or some low dimensional set of features related to the waveform, such as amplitude or half-width.  

We model the joint mark intensity function parametrically as a mixture of Gaussians.  However, non-stationarities complicate the modeling, as the statistics of the marks vary over time due to instability in the recording hardware, and the relationship between neural activity and behavior can change as an animal learns or adapts to the task.  Fitting the model using all available data conflates the non-stationarity as the variability of each of the Gaussian components in the mixture.  We introduce an algorithm that uses the data not at once, but sequentially in chunks, to fit the mixture of Gaussians.  This can be interpreted as ""updating"" the model parameters when newer data arrives, and allows the model to track the non-stationarity in the data.  Parameters are updated and not re-fit completely, because at each update, the model parameters are summarized by their posterior distributions, and incorporated in the update as a prior distribution for that parameter.
Another important aspect in advancing this modeling framework is the development of goodness-of-fit techniques which enable us to have an accurate and interpretable assessment of the fitted model to the observed full spike events. We discuss a set of new transformations for the marked-point process models of the population spiking activity which generate a new data points that are uniformly and identically distributed in the new mark and time spaces under the correct model. These transformations are the extension of the time-rescaled theorem for point-process models. Furthermore, these transformations are scalable to multi-dimensional mark spaces and provide independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) samples in hypercubes, which are best suited for uniformity tests. We discuss a list of uniformity tests applicable to multivariate uniform samples and demonstrate applications of these transformation and uniformity tests in a simulation and neural data recorded from rat hippocampus.
Through this session, we discuss our recent research on marked-point process modeling framework and in particular, its application in real-time analysis of ensemble neural activity recorded from rat hippocampus. We then further discuss our recent research efforts on advancing the marked-point process applications in neural data analysis. We discuss about our new adaptive sequentially updated joint mark intensity function model estimation; we also discuss a set of new goodness-of-fit tools and theories we developed to assess how good the estimated marked intensity functions capture information carried in the neural data.

In the new era of extraordinary advancements in computer science and information technology, and the continuously increasing abundance of available data, Data Science has emerged as a promising interdisciplinary approach for extracting, organizing and analyzing information from complicated systems. Statistics plays an essential role in exploring, describing, visualizing and interpreting the underlying variability and structure of those systems, as well as to accurately predict outcomes of interest for different scenarios in an efficient, well structured, and valid way. 
The primary objective of this session is to discuss statistical methods for the development of complex predictive models broadly used in Data Science, and present applications in the fields of health science, policy, economics and decision making. The methodology presented in this session will cover a variety of predictive modeling approaches, including microsimulation models, deep learning algorithms, multistate and cohort models. Applications of the methodology will come from a broad spectrum ranging from health economics and medical decision making to specific approaches for modeling life data of complicated structure such as recurrent events and censoring observations.

Latent variables, such as ability, preferences and purchasing behaviors, are not observed directly. Instead, to study them, one must rely on surrogate data as observable indicators. The Bayesian approach provides a natural framework for studying latent variable models because hidden and observed traits can be explicitly related to one another via a joint probability model.

Title: Robust regression for microbiome data analysis


With recent advances in low-cost 16S rRNA sequencing technique, we have access to data sets about microbial communities abundance and its host environments like human, ocean or soil. However, analyzing these large and complex data to understand the microbial ecosystem comes with particular statistical challenges, including compositionality, over-dispersion, and zero-inflation. In particular, inferring causality, understanding multivariate association among the microbial community, and robust modeling of phenotypes remains a paramount open problem. In this session, we bring experts with a focus on using and developing statistical methods to solve the data analysis problems in microbiome research. Our speaker will present novel statistical regression, mediation, and network inference techniques that address these important tasks.

  
The first speaker, Huilin Li (Department of Population Health, NYU Langone Health), will present a method for causal mediation analysis of high dimensional and compositional microbiome data. The second speaker, Himel Mallick (Reseach Fellow, Harvard University), will introduce a multivariate association statistics to measure ecological and functional interactions from microbiome count data. Our last speaker Aditya Mishra (Center for Computational Mathematics, Flatiron Institute) will present a novel robust regression framework for compositional data, with an application to gut microbiome data.
