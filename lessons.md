# Abstract submission

+ Affiliation warning (print as is)
+ Authors other than presenters: only names will be sufficient (no affiliation, which causes a mess)
+ Limit abstract word counts (seen abstracts of medical journal style)
+ Student competition should be accompanied by registration _and_ abstract submission to the poster session
+ Abstract submission reminder should be clear on consequences of not
  submitting on time
  
# Fundraising

+ Fundraising should start much earlier
    - NSF takes long time to review
    - Bloomberg reviews in every fall
    - Google needs deeper involvement with their people

+ Fundraising should have a clear statement on what sponsors get
    - Display table
    - Named event
    - Ads in program book

# Chairing sessions

+ Introduce yourself first (not everyone knows you)
+ Introduce speakers or guests with their full names instead of first
  names only
