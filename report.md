The Department of Statistics of the University of Connecticut proudly hosted the first remodeled, 3-day New England Statistics Symposium (NESS) since the establishment of the New England Statistical Society, on May 15–17, 2019. The theme was "Statistical Data Science in Action". It took place in Hilton Hartford because Nathan Hale Inn was being renovated at the time. The symposium featured short-courses, plenary talks, invited sessions, career development panel discussions, student paper competition, student poster competition, Stat-a-thon, the inaugural Chernoff Lecture, and a special session Honoring our own Professor Rick Vitale. Close to 500 participants attended the symposium.


Four short-courses were taught on the first day. Two were full-day: "Intermediate Machine Learning: Key Concepts and Techniques" by Dr. David Rosenberg (Bloomberg); and "Big Data Analytics and Deep Learning" by Dr. Ming Li (Amazon) and Dr. Hui Lin (Netlify). The other two were half-day: "Practical Visualization for Data Scientists" by Dr. Xiaoyue Cheng (University of Nebraska at Omaha); and "Introduction to Multilevel Modeling" by Dr. Min Zhu (SAS). The short courses were all well-attended and we had to cap the enrollments of some courses at 30 due to space limitations. A mixer followed the short-courses at the end of the first day, sponsored by the Munich Re Group - The Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Co.


Thursday, May 16, started with a welcome remark from the 2019 President of the New England Statistics Society and Head of our department, Prof. Ming-Hui Chen, and two keynote presentations. The first keynote talk was "Big Data, Google and Disease Detection: A Statistical Adventure" by Prof. Sam Kou of Harvard University. The second keynote talk was "Machine Learning for Structured and Unstructured Data in Finance", presented jointly by Drs. David Rosenberg and Amanda Stent of Bloomberg. A total of 63 invited sessions covered a wide spectrum of areas of Statistical Data Science in Action. In addition to showcases of Statistical Data Science in Action in many fronts and fields, we also had sessions on education and career development on topics including career opportunities, effective communications, teaching data science, and leadership. 


The poster session was held in the late afternoon Thursday, May 16. It had 48 posters, mostly presented by students competing for the Liberty Mutual Student Poster Awards. Dr. Anthony D’Amico of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham & Women’s Hospital delivered the first banquet talk in the NESS history, "Patient Outcomes in Prostate Cancer by Partnering Statistics and Medicine." The ingaural president of the New England Statistical Society, Prof. Xiao-Li Meng of Harvard University, made toasts which were interesting and thought-provoking as usual.


A special session in the afternoon of Friday, May 17, entitled "Probability, Statistics, and Geometry: A Special Session Honoring Rick Vitale," celebrated Rick’s academic achievements and his 75th birthday. David Pollard (Yale University) was chair, and talks relating to Rick’s work were given by Andrew Barron (Yale University), "Gaussian Complexity, Metric Entropy, and Risk of Deep Nets”; David Donoho (Stanford University), "The Statistical Significance of Perfect Linear Separation”; and Subhashis Ghoshal (North Carolina State University), "Coverage of Credible Intervals for Monotone Regression.” Rick concluded the session with thanks to the organizers and with a suggestion to younger colleagues that they always find time for research problems that genuinely intrigue them. The session was recorded and can be viewed online:

The conference concluded on Friday afternoon with a new addition to NESS, the Chernoff Lecture. The Chernoff Excellence in Statistics Awards is the most prestigious award bestowed by the Society to an individual who, in the tradition of Herman Chernoff’s work, has made exceptional contributions to the theory, methodology, or novel applications to statistics and/or data science. The inaugural recipient of the Chernoff Award was Shaw-Hwa Lo, Professor of Statistics at Columbia University. The awardee's identity remained a secret until the presentation of the award, which was presented by Dr. Joe Cappelleri, President-Elect of the New England Statistical Society and Chair of the Chernoff Award Committee. Prof. Lo delivered the first Chernoff Lecture in the NESS history, "Interaction-based Variable Selection and Big Data Prediction."


The closing award ceremony also featured three student awards. The IBM Student Paper Awards, continuously sponsored the IBM Watson Research Center, went to Moming Li, Yan Li, Xiaokang Liu, and Wei Shi. Except Moming Li of George Mason University, the other three awardees were all from UConn Statistics. The winning papers were: Moming Li, Guoqing Diao, and Jing Qin, "On Symmetric Semiparametric Two-sample Problem"; Yan Li, Kun Chen, Jun Yan and Xuebin Zhang, "Weight Matrix Construction in Fingerprinting to Improve Detection of Global Temperature Signals in Historical Climate"; Xiaokang Liu, Shujie Ma and Kun Chen, "Multivariate Functional Regression via Nested Reduced-Rank Regularization"; and Wei Shi, Ming-Hui Chen, Lynn Kuo and Paul Lewis, "New Bayesian Measures for Information and Data Compatibility". The Liberty Mutual Student Poster Awards went to Shajratul Alam, University of Rhode Island; Paul Mclaughlin, University of Connecticut; Jiahui Yu, University of Massachusetts Amherst; and Xiaojing Zhu, Boston University.


A companion event of the 2019 NESS was the Travelers Stat-a-thon sponsored by our longtime industry partner Travelers. We had two themes, Connecticut Housing in partnership with Connecticut Open Data, and Customer Retention in partnership with Travelers. The winners of the Connecticut Housing theme were: 1st Place: Team Bentley (Madhurya Baruah, Pooja Sudheendra, Wenqi Wang, and Yueyi Wang, all from Bentley University); 2nd Place: LLJW (Peng Jin, New York University; Myeonggyun Lee, New York University; Chihua Li, Columbia University; Bin Wang, New York University); 3rd Place: KAE-Group (Anhar Aloufi, Daniel Kpormegbey, and Katherine Zavez, all from University of Connecticut). An honorable mention was given to two high school students, Richard Dong and Christa Malan of Easton Country Day School. The winners of the Customer Retention theme were: 1st Place: Rule of Three (Ariel Chernofsky, Boston University; Nina Orwitz, New York University; Serena Zhan, Columbia University); 2nd Place: Q.E.D. (Yizhou Mi, Shengjun Wang, Jiaxi Yang, and Weibo Zhang, all from Columbia University).


The 2019 NESS Organizing Committee consisted of Haim Bar, HaiYing Wang, and Jun Yan (chair). The Stat-a-thon committee was chaired by HaiYing Wang. The Student Paper Committee was co-chaired by Yuping Zhang of UConn Statistics and Beatriz (Stefa) Ethcegaray of IBM Watson Research Center. The Student Poster Committee was co-chaired by Valarie Bazaaro of Wesleyan University, '13 PhD, and Zhenkui Zhang of Liberty Mutual, '05 PhD. The Fundraising Committee was chaired by Dipak Dey. The Program Committee was co-chaired by Kun Chen, Gavino Puggioni of University of Rhode Island, and Jun Yan. The committees consists of many people from many institutions. The success of the conference depended on the collective efforts of all. 


We thank our sponsors, Department of Statistics, University of Connecticut, ASA Connecticut Chapter, IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Liberty Mutual Insurance, Munich Re Group -- The Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Co., Pfizer, Taylor & Francis, and Travelers Insurance. Like with all other events organized by the department, our student volunteers, led by Jieying Jiao, played a critical role in supporting the conference in all aspects from staffing the registration desk to handling the visual equipment. Our student webmaster Yan Li developed and maintained the webpage, the registration system, and the abstract submission system of the conference. Our department staff Tracy Burke and Anthony Luis have been our indispensable support as always. Kate Copeland of University Events and Conference Services helped extensively with her professional expertise.

The 34th NESS will be held on May 21--23, 2020, at the University of Rhode Island.
